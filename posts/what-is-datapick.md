Datapick is a data labelling tool used for various use cases. Today, we are seeing an interest in automatization. You can take a look at companies like Tesla and their self-driving cars. You may wonder how do these cars work and why they drive confidently. The answer is data. The data are labelled. The labelling process usually involves humans and artificial intelligence, which verifies the annotation made by humans. A great example of a data labelling platform is Scale AI, which was founded in 2016 and grew very quickly during the first months. I have been inspired by these companies and wanted to develop a similar data annotation platform. That's how the idea for Datapick originated. Right now, the platform has these use cases:

- User can create its account
- User can create projects
- User can upload data to projects
- User can define taxonomy for the project
- User can label the data
- User can download/copy the labeled data (coordinates, width - height)

The platform is a bachelors project in university. Take that into account. It gets the job done and is coded to be easy to understand. The platform is open-source software, and anyone can fork the software and modify it. If anyone is wondering how data annotation platforms work, take a look at this project.
